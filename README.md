# ProNet
A social network designed for productivity


This is a REST-ful social network designed using Django-Rest framework in the backend and React.js in the frontend.
Current version allows a user to create, update, delete of posts and comments. A user can view his profile and others profile.
A user can follow another user and can also be followed. Also, this network provides a summary of the usage statistics (e.g. number of posts, comments by the user).

The goal of this project is to create a network such that users will be mindful of their network usage. While using the network, users will exactly know the usage time for browsing differnt parts of the network. For example, a user will know how much she spent reading post, browsing profile, creating post, commenting etc.
Also, this network ensures that a user will not fall into the "black-hole" of scrolling infintely by providing pagination.

The primary contribution of this project is the design of a React library to easily perform all sorts of API request.

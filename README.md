# ProNet
A social network designed for productivity

Please explore the site at: http://13.82.0.54/ (Sorry, I didn't buy domain yet)
You can also explore the REST-API of ProNet at: http://13.82.0.54:8000/swagger/

This is a REST-ful social network designed using Django-Rest framework in the backend and React.js in the frontend.
Current version allows a user to create, update, delete of posts and comments. A user can view his profile and others profile.
A user can follow another user and can also be followed. Also, this network provides a summary of the usage statistics (e.g. number of posts, comments by the user).

In future, I will add a timer feature so that an user can see the amount of time spent in the network while browsing the network. There are lot more cool features in my plan. So, keep visiting and exploring ProNet :)

The goal of this project is to create a network such that users would be mindful of their network usage. While using the network, an user will be able to see the exact usage time for browsing differnt parts of the network. For example, a user will know how much she spent reading post, browsing profile, creating post, commenting etc.
Also, this network ensures that a user will not fall into the "black-hole" of scrolling infintely by providing pagination.

So please visit this site and make some posts and comments to let me know what you want from a social network, what can be done to increase the productivity of a social network user.

The primary contribution of this project is the design of a React library to easily perform all sorts of API request.
